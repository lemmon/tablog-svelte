Svelte, my friend,<br>
Your code is light and swift,<br>
Building my theme.

Clean and elegant,<br>
You make my blog a joy,<br>
A pleasure to see.

With you by my side,<br>
I can focus on content,<br>
And let you shine.

Thank you, Svelte,<br>
For making my blog come alive,<br>
And making it great.
