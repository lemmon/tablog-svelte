Wind whispers softly,  
A new dawn in our designs,  
Tailwind guides our code.

In the calm of code,  
Utility now leads us,  
Class by class, we shape.

Gone are the long styles,  
Simplicity at our core,  
Beauty in each line.

Margins, padding, clean,  
Responsive by nature’s hand,  
Tailwind flows with ease.

With each passing day,  
Our code breathes in the fresh air,  
Tailwind leads our way.

Styles now light as air,  
We embrace the journey's flow,  
Tailwind is our guide.
